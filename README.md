# Marking Spreadsheet Generator
The goal of this program is to easily be able to create marking spreadsheets with custom parameters. These spreadsheets will have inbuilt formulas that aggregate the marks for individual questions and comments into a single cell for easy copy pasting into the grading system. It's modelled off of how I create marking spreadsheets.

Customizable options include:
* Number of questions
* Maximum marks for each question
* Whether or not postgraduate questions exist
* The ability to include comments
